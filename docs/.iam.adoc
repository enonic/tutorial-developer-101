When you deploy  your XP instance to anywhere outside of your own, local computer, you're most likely going to want to restrict access to parts of it. You very likely aren't going to want to leave your admin pages open to the public, and in many cases you're also going to want to create content that requires a user to log in before accessing it. To facilitate that, XP uses something called identity providers (_ID providers_ for short).

This {document} covers the basics of _Identity and Access Management_ (IAM) in XP. It covers _users_, _groups_, and _roles_, _permissions_, and finally how to set up and configure ID providers in XP.

== Principals: Users, groups, and roles
// This does not need to be a deep dive on these topics, but it should give the reader an overview of what these are and why they exist. Should also mention the granularity with which they can be applied.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_(computer_security)[According to Wikipedia], A _principal_ is

[quote, Wikipedia: Principal (computer security)]
 [...] an entity that can be authenticated by a computer system or network. [...] Principals can be individual people, computers, services, computational entities such as processes and threads, or any group of such things.

The XP IAM system has three principals: _users_, _groups_, and _roles_.

A _user_ is the most basic kind of principal. As you might expect, they correspond to login credentials and are typically given out to each physical user. A user principal can be a member of any number of groups and be assigned any number of roles.

A _group_ is a collection of users. Each group can contain any number of users. Additionally, a group may be assigned any number of roles. Each member that is part of a group is then also assigned all the roles that a group has.

A _role_ provides application-specific functionality. Each application can bundle a number of roles, each of which gives the assignee permission to perform certain actions related to the application. For instance: the _Administrator_ role comes bundled with XP. Any user with this role (either directly or transitively via their group) gets full access to all content and admin tools in XP.

== Permissions

Permissions tell the system what actions a user, group, or role can perform. That is: permissions grant authorization to perform certain actions. Use them to give fine-grained access to items in the NoSQL storage, such as pieces of content in Content Studio or ..?

.Questions
- What items are in NoSQL storage? Should it be NoQL storage?
- What sort of items have permissions and what sort of items do not?

For instance, if you wanted to assign let a group create users in an ID provider, you could grant the group permissions on the ID provider page, assuming you have the necessary permissions to do so.

.ID provider permissions input element
image::iam-assign-permissions.png["A permissions form element for an ID provider. There is a dropdown open for a custom group, which asks which permissions to grant. The options are 'read', 'create users' 'write users', 'id provider manager', and 'administrator'."]

== ID providers

The last piece of the IAM puzzle is ID providers. ID providers are what allows your users to log and authenticate. ID providers is also how you _create_ users in XP.

ID providers consist of:

- a unique name
- an ID provider application that controls how authentication works
- permissions that control who can manage the ID provider

That's right. ID providers wrap ID provider applications, which are also usually referred to only as _ID providers_. That can get a bit confusing, but I'm sure you can get through it.

We have two _separate_ forms of ID providers: _ID provider applications_ (often just referred to as _ID providers_), which provide the logic and mechanisms to authenticate, and the _ID providers_ you create in the Users application. The ID providers you create _use_ ID provider applications for their logic, but also add their own configuration via their names and permissions. That way, you can have multiple ID providers that use the same authentication logic (the ID provider application).

ID providers are hooked up to sites or applications via https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/deployment/vhosts[virtual hosts] and control access to certain URLs. You can use separate ID providers for separate paths.

== Task: restrict admin access

Time to put what we have learned about in this {document} to use! Combined with what we covered <<deployment#vhosts, about virtual hosts in the previous {document}>>, we'll use a new ID provider to secure the admin console of our XP instance.

When you're done with the task you'll have:

. installed Simple ID Provider
. created your own id provider and a user
. configured your xp instance's vhosts to use your new id provider

So let's get started!

=== Step 1: Install the Simple ID Provider app

The first thing you need to do is to install the Simple ID Provider app:

. Navigate to the Applications tab in the XP menu.
. Press "Install" and search for Simple ID Provider.
+
.Installing the Simple ID Provider app
image::iam-install-simple-id-provider.png["A search field with containing 'simple id provider'. There is one result showing: the Simple ID Provider app. To the right is an 'install' button."]
+
. Install the application.

=== Step 2: Create your ID provider

Now that you have the ID provider app installed, let's create the ID provider in the Users app.

. Navigate to Users from the Admin panel.
. Press "New..." and select the ID Provider option from the dialog.
+
.Creating an ID provider
image::iam-create-id-provider.png["A header saying 'Create New' and a list of options: 'user', 'user group', 'ID provider', 'role'."]
+
. Call the provider "{provider}" and give it an optional description if you want to.
. In the application input field, select the Simple ID Provider.
. If you want to, you can use the edit button to configure the ID provider app. The edit button looks like the end of a pencil.
+
.Configuring the ID provider
image::iam-configure-id-provider-app.png["A configuration form allowing you to configure 'title', 'theme', whether to use a gravatar picture, 'session timeout', and what to do when a user forgets their password."]
+
. You can inspect the "Permissions" input field if you're interested and assign any extra permissions. However, the defaults will suffice for this task.
. Save the ID provider and return to the Users app.

=== Step 3: Create a user

Now that you have an ID provider, you can create a user!

. In the Users app's content grid, navigate to the provider you just created ({provider}). Expand it and select the "Users" folder that's nested beneath it.
. The "New..." button should now say "New User". Press it and create a new user.
. Provide the user with an appropriate name
. Add an email and a password. The email does not have to be real and is simply used as a login name. Remember what you put as the password: you'll need it later.
. Assign the "Administrator" role to your user.
+
NOTE: Your user needs to have at least one of the "Administrator" and "Administration Console Login" roles assigned to be able to log in
+
.An example user creation form
image::iam-user-creation-form.png["A user creation form filled out. It contains values for 'email', 'password' and 'roles'."]
+
. Save the user.

=== Step 4: Configure vhosts

With the ID provider and user created, all we need to do is to wire up the id provider.

. Find your sandbox's vhost config file. As a reminder, its default location is at `.enonic/sandboxes/<sandbox-name>/home/config/com.enonic.xp.web.vhost.cfg` from your home directory.
. Edit the vhost config and add the following block:
+
[source,properties,{subs}]
----
mapping.admin.host = {host}
mapping.admin.source = /
mapping.admin.target = /admin
mapping.admin.idProvider.my-provider = default
----
+
. Next, to make sure that you can reach the host, update your system hosts file and add the following mapping:
+
[source, hosts, {subs}]
----
127.0.0.1 {host}
----


=== Step 5: Log in

Now everything should be ready to go, so let's try it out.

. Head to {host}:8080. You should be greeted with something that looks a bit like this (depending on how you customized the application):
+
.Login form
image::iam-id-provider-login.png["A short login form requiring email and password."]
+
. Fill out the form and log in. Use the credentials for the user you created previously.

If all goes well, you should be taken to the admin console and your username should show in the bottom of the admin panel. If something didn't work: go over the steps above and make sure you've followed them correctly.
