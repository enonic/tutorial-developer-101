If you want to work with rich text in Content Studio, HtmlArea is the input type to go. 

This input type offers some very powerful editing capabilities and a lot of configuration options. 

This whole {document} is dedicated to https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/cms/input-types#htmlarea[HtmlArea input type] and the editor used to define its data. For a full detailed exaplanation of the Rich text editor used in content studio, please visit the https://developer.enonic.com/docs/content-studio/stable/editor/rich-text-editor[Rich text editor reference documentation].

NOTE: {see-prev-docs}

== Overview

.The HtmlArea input type with the default tools selection
image::input-type-html-area.png["A text input field with a tools ribbon just above.", {image-s}, align=center]

The HtmlArea input type gives you a multi-line input field with rich formatting options, much like what you're used to from your favorite word processor. It supports text formatting and justification, lists, links, and even lets you insert images.

You can configure the HtmlArea to be exactly what you want by dictating what formatting tools to include or exclude (the `include` and `exclude` attributes, respectively), by what heading levels are allowed (`allowedHeadings`), and by giving it a default value (`default`).

Additionally, the HtmlArea supports the use of _macros_, giving you the ability to insert prefabricated rich components into your markup.

== HtmlArea include and exclude

We can use the HtmlArea's `config` section to specify which rich text controls should be available when editing. Using a combination of the `include` and `exclude` tags, we can customize the input's appearance.

By default, it includes a limited, but useful selection of tools at your disposal. Using `<include>*</include>` as an option is the same as including the default tools.

.The HtmlArea with default configuration
[source,xml]
----
<input type="HtmlArea" name="everything">
  <label>HtmlArea</label>
</input>
----

If you want to exclude all controls, use `<exclude>*</exclude>`:

.The HtmlArea configured to include nothing
[source,xml]
----
<input type="HtmlArea" name="nothing">
  <label>HtmlArea with exclude: *</label>
  <config>
    <exclude>*</exclude>
  </config>
</input>
----

.An HtmlArea exput with `<exclude>*</exclude>` and a selection of tools.
image::input-type-html-area-no-controls.png[An HtmlArea configured to exclude all editing tools, {image-s}, align=center]

Finally, if you want to exclude most tools, but not all, you can exclude all and then add back in the ones you want:

.The HtmlArea configured to include a selection of controls
[source,xml]
----
<input type="HtmlArea" name="something">
  <label>HtmlArea with some controls</label>
  <config>
    <exclude>*</exclude>
    <include>Format | Bold Italic Underline | JustifyBlock
    JustifyLeft JustifyCenter JustifyRight | HorizontalRule Blockquote</include>
  </config>
</input>
----

.An HtmlArea with a selection of tools and `<exclude>*</exclude>`
image::input-type-html-area-some-controls.png[An HtmlArea configured to include a selection of editing tools, {image-s}, align=center]

As introduced in the beginning, for a full overview of the available text tools and HtmlArea configuration options, visit the https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/cms/input-types#htmlarea[HtmlArea input type reference docs].

=== Task: {content-type-2-capitalized} description

Let's add a rich-text description field to the {content-type-2} content type. The input should be optional and have at most a single occurrence. You can include any editor tools you want, but it must at least have the `Link` ,`Image` and `Macro` tools, as we'll be using these later. Otherwise, configure it as you want.

Your content type should now look something like this:

.{content-type-2-capitalized} with an HtmlArea input type
[source,xml,{subs}]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<content-type>
  <display-name>{content-type-2-capitalized}</display-name>
  <description>An {content-type-2} that lives on planet Earth</description>
  <super-type>base:structured</super-type>
  <form>

    <!-- other fields elided for brevity -->

    <input name="description" type="HtmlArea">
      <label>Description</label>
      <help-text>
        Describe the animal. Where its habitats are, what it eats, etc.
      </help-text>
      <config>
        <exclude>*</exclude>
        <include>Format Link Macro Image</include>
      </config>
    </input>

  </form>
</content-type>
----

With the new content type deployed, you are ready to continue with further tasks we'll introduce in next sections.

== Links 

In addition to good old URLs, the Rich text editor provides a more powerful way of creating links, in which you can:

- Reference other content items (possbily passing query parameters);
- If the referenced content is of type media, you can set a specific link to: open the file, directly download the file, or treat it as a regular content;
- Insert url links of type: https, http, ftp, cel or relative;

An important feature, is that when creating internal links (content or media links), XP will save a references to the target items, similar to how the ContentSelector works. This is useful when looking for usage and dependencies between content items later.

NOTE: Because links are created using the item's unique id. It is perfectly safe to move items around in the tree structure, or change it's path name. The links will not break.

=== Task: Internal link

In this task, you'll create an internal link to another {content-type-2}. 

Create a new {content-type-2}, "Lynx".

. In the `Description` field, type some text, i.e. "Lynx are cats, just like lions". Select the "lions" text and click "insert link" in the toolbar.
+
NOTE: You can also use kbd:[ctrl+K] to insert the link.
+
. You'll be greeted by the "Insert link" dialog:
.Choose the content tab, and select the previously created "Lion" as the target item
+
image::rich-text-insert-content-link.png[Screenshot of the insert link dialog,{image-l}]

When done, save the item - but keep the tab open to complete the upcoming tasks.

== Images

With the image tool enabled, you insert an image anywhere within your document. During the insert process, you may customize the image further. 

The following options are available: Caption, alt text, change the image's justification, and apply a predefined image styles. 

=== Task: {content-type-2-capitalized} pictures

Try out the image controls that Content Studio give you by uploading a picture and seeing what you can do with it. 

We looked at xref:input-types#_working_with_images[editing images in the previous {document}], but when inserting images in the HtmlArea, you also have something called "image styles", which we'll have a look at now.

Continue editing the "Lynx" content created in the previous task.

. Insert an image below the existing text. Use the "insert image" button in the toolbar.
+
.The toolbar with the image tool highlighted
image::rich-text-toolbar-image-highlight.png[The rich text toolbar with the image tool circled by a blue circle,{image-l}]
+
. You'll be greeted by the "insert image" dialog:
+

image::rich-text-insert-image.png["The insert image dialog, showing the image, an image styles dropdown, caption, and alt text fields", {image-l}]
+
. When accessing the "image styles" dropdown, you'll find that it's only got two options and neither of them seem to do much. To make this more exciting, let's also create a custom image style.
+
In your app, add a new file:
+
.src/main/resources/site/styles.xml
[source,xml,{subs}]
----
<styles>
  <image name="square-grayscale">
    <display-name>Grayscale</display-name>
    <aspect-ratio>1:1</aspect-ratio> // <1>
    <filter>hsbcolorize(0x000000); grayscale(); border(6, 0x000000)</filter> // <2>
  </image>
</styles>
----
+
<1> The aspect ratio controls how the image is displayed. 1:1 makes the image square.
<2> The filters add a grayscale effect and then a border
+
NOTE: https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/cms/styles[The styles reference doc] has more information on how you can style your images, so go check it out for a deeper dive.
+
. With this style picked up by XP, you'll have the "Grayscale" option available in the image styles dropdown. Select it to apply it to the image and update your image.
+
.Example of description with inserted image styled
image::rich-text-insert-image-styled.png["The description rich text showing the results of applying the image styles to the image", {image-l}]

== Macros

Macros enable you to insert custom components within your rich text field

When the content is rendered, the macro is replaced with the actual component implementation.

Similar to content types, macros can define forms that help editors configure them.

=== Task: Embed iframe macro

The embed macro enable you to insert iframes. In this context, we'll embed this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gr5EwZo_CHQ[Lynx youtube video].

Let's add the macro to the "Lynx" content item.

.The toolbar with the macro button highlighted
image::rich-text-toolbar-macro-highlight.png[The rich text toolbar with the macro button circled by a blue circle,{image-l}]

. Click "insert macro".
. Select the "Embed iframe" macro
. Add the following iframe to it: `<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gr5EwZo_CHQ?si=IlkTGRuGVV7BxEOs" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>`

NOTE: This macro can't be previewed because the Embed iframe macro does not includes a standard preview. 

As you'll see in next section, when querying the description of an Animal content, you'll be able to properly get the iframe we passed to "Embed iframe" macro and process it as you'd like in your front-end.

TIP: For more information on macros, including how to create your very own, visit to https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/cms/macros[the macro reference docs].

== GraphQL API

When fetching rich text via the API, the most commonly used output is "processed html". This is essentially unstyled, semantic HTML. It's then up to you to style the content in your client.

Links, images and macros will potentially require additional client-side processing.

The following query returns the "Lynx" content, and the `description` field al processed HTML.

.Fetching rich text via GraphQL API
[source,GraphQL,{subs}]
----
{
  guillotine {
    queryDsl(
      query: {
        term: {
          field: "displayName",
          value: {
            string: "Lynx"
          }
        }
      }
    ) {
      ... on {project-name-query}_{content-type-2-Capitalized} {
        data {
          description {
            processedHtml
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----

.The query result may look something like this
[source,json]
----
{
  "data": {
    "guillotine": {
      "queryDsl": [
        {
          "data": {
            "description": {
              "processedHtml": "<p>Lynx are cats, just like <a href=\"/admin/site/preview/my-first-project/draft/animals/lion\" data-link-ref=\"8cc82fd1-9063-4604-9f51-5f059d7a5d2e\">lions</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"captioned editor-align-justify square-grayscale\"><img alt=\"lynx.jpg\" src=\"/admin/site/preview/my-first-project/draft/_/image/be6bb93a-7d99-4ed2-b424-4e435b89f392:6a1e144ef4ebab19e9071794ad753130d5bb5497/width-768/lynx.jpg\" style=\"width:100%\" data-image-ref=\"4dced964-cd1c-445d-bb9f-80387467e165\">\n\n</figure>\n\n<p><editor-macro data-macro-name=\"embed\" data-macro-ref=\"a1490c65-3654-4b29-9b1a-eb3894b6f59f\">&lt;iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gr5EwZo_CHQ?si=IlkTGRuGVV7BxEOs\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</editor-macro></p>\n"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
----

By unescaping the HTML, you will find the following:

.Processed HTML output
[source,html]
----
<p>
  Lynx are cats, just like <a href="/admin/site/preview/my-first-project/draft/animals/lion" data-link-ref="8cc82fd1-9063-4604-9f51-5f059d7a5d2e">lions</a>.
</p>

<figure class="captioned editor-align-justify square-grayscale">

  </editor-macro>
</p>

----

With the excepton of macro's this is all valid HTML. Below, you'll learn more about handling these elements.

=== Links

Looking specifically at the processed html link output above, the most interesting part is the `data-link-ref` attribute.

NOTE: Wondering why the href points to a location within the admin? No worries. Guillotine automatically generates contextual links. When deploying the API to production, you may customize the base url as needed.

This example is an internal link, you may want access more details about it, for instance to override the URL, optimize accessibility etc. 

To acccess these details, you need to extend your query with the links field:

.Query for link details
[source,GraphQL,{subs}]
----
{
  guillotine {
    queryDsl(
      query: {
        term: {
          field: "displayName",
          value: {
            string: "Lynx"
          }
        }
      }
    ) {
      ... on {project-name-query}_{content-type-2-Capitalized} {
        data {
          description {
            processedHtml
            links {
              ref
              uri
              content {
                displayName
                _path
                type
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----

By executing this query, you will get some more data. Specifically:

.Link query result
[source,GraphQL]
----
...
"links": [
  {
    "ref": "5c351456-b22f-4162-aad6-6d921c686544",
    "uri": "content://89daa74e-1482-493d-9a22-8ec08acaf4f8",
    "content": {
      "displayName": "Lion",
      "_path": "/animals/lion",
      "type": "com.example.myproject:animal"
    }
  }
]
...
----

As you can see, you now have access to the full name of the referenced item, as well as it's type. Use the ref values from the HTML link element to match it with the specific link data - as you may have more than one link.


=== Image srcset

In the processed HTML, you can see the `<img>` element with style attributes. Additionally, by looking more closely at the `src` value, you will find that the style settings are applied in the image service URL.

  ..../_/image/<id>:<version>/width-768/lynx.jpg

But wait, there's more! 

If you want to optimize how fast images load on various devices, Guillotine can also return the image in multiple different sizes (using https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/srcset[the `srcset` attribute (MDN)]). This is achieved by adding an argument to the `description` field:

.Fetching rich text with `srcset`
[source,GraphQL,]
----
{
  guillotine {
    queryDsl(
      query: {
        term: {
          field: "displayName",
          value: {
            string: "Lynx"
          }
        }
      }
    ) {
      ... on {project-name-query}_{content-type-2-Capitalized} {
        data {
          description(processHtml: {imageWidths: [200, 500]}) {
            processedHtml
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----

This time, you should find the '<img>' element will include srcset with links to a 200w and 500w respectively.

.Img tag, now with srcset
[source,Html]
----
<img alt="lynx.jpg"
  src=".../width-768/lynx.jpg"
  style="width:100%"
  srcset=".../width-200/lynx jpg 200w,.../width-500/lynx.jpg 500w"
  data-image-ref="c771dac7-8158-4791-92fb-18ebd5ef2fd3" />
----

NOTE: URLs about above were shortened for readability

=== Image details

If you prefer to handle all details related to images yourself, or optimize the markup further, you may access more details about the image - like you did for links.

.Get description with image style details
[source,GraphQL,{subs}]
----
{
  guillotine {
    queryDsl(
      query: {
        term: {
          field: "displayName",
          value: {
            string: "Lynx"
          }
        }
      }
    ) {
      ... on {project-name-query}_{content-type-2-Capitalized} {
        data {
          description {
            images {
              style {
                name
                aspectRatio
                filter
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----

You can extract the properties that you specified in your `styles.xml` previously:

.Additional result of fetching image styles
[source,json]
----
...
"images": [
  {
    "style": {
      "name": "editor-style-grayscale",
      "aspectRatio": "1:1",
      "filter": "hsbcolorize(0x000000); grayscale(); border(6, 0x000000)"
    }
  }
]
...
----

=== Macros

In the headless context, the client is responsible for rendering of your content. In the case of macros - this gets obvious. 

In the processed HTML, each macro is represented by an `<editor-macro>` element containing a unique reference key. As for links and images, this reference can be used to access detailed data fields for the macro.

.Query that fetches all macro data
[source,GraphQL,{subs}]
----
{
  guillotine {
    queryDsl(
      query: {
        term: {
          field: "displayName",
          value: {
            string: "Lynx"
          }
        }
      }
    ) {
      ... on {project-name-query}_{content-type-2-Capitalized} {
        data {
          description {
            processedHtml
            macrosAsJson
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----


.MacrosAsJson response (extract)
[source,json]
----
...
"macrosAsJson": [
  {
    "ref": "1f8703bc-ee13-4871-89b3-937a7299abc4",
    "name": "embed",
    "descriptor": "system:embed",
    "config": {
      "embed": {
        "body": "&lt;iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gr5EwZo_CHQ?si=IlkTGRuGVV7BxEOs\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;"
      }
    }
  }
]
...
----

To access specific macros and fields, like for content type may use the full GraphQL schema. Try the following:

NOTE: If you used a different macro than the "Embed iframe" macro, the query must be updated to match the specific macro.

.Query that fetches the fields for the Embed iframe macro 
[source,GraphQL,{subs}]
----
{
  guillotine {
    queryDsl(
      query: {
        term: {
          field: "displayName",
          value: {
            string: "Lynx"
          }
        }
      }
    ) {
      ... on {project-name-query}_{content-type-2-Capitalized} {
        data {
          description {
            processedHtml
            macros {
              ref
              name
              descriptor
              config {
                embed {
                  body
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----

This time, you only get the explicit fields you were looking for

.Output from the field-based query
[source,json]
----
...
"macros": [
  {
    "ref": "9918c7b2-c87d-4d0b-8d6c-56ab85805f3a",
    "name": "embed",
    "descriptor": "system:embed",
    "config": {
      "embed": {
        "body": "&lt;iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gr5EwZo_CHQ?si=IlkTGRuGVV7BxEOs\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;"
      }
    }
  }
]
...
----

By accessing the macro config, you are able to down drill into every single field, accessing all the details you actually you need.
