XP also offers ways for you to group inputs, both visually and structurally. Collectively, these are known as sets. This {document} explains what they are and how to use them.

NOTE: {see-prev-docs}

== Field sets

Field sets are the simplest form of sets XP offers... they group inputs visually and have no effect on the data model.

In a schema, the field set element wraps the input elements it should contain. 

To create a field set that contains a TextLine and a TextArea, the markup would look like this:

.A field set
[source, xml]
----
<field-set>
  <label>FieldSet</label>
  <items> // <1>
    <input type="TextLine" name="fieldSetTextLine">
      <label>Heading</label>
    </input>
    <input type="TextArea" name="fieldSetTextArea">
      <label>Text</label>
      <help-text>Write something? üñäÔ∏è</help-text>
    </input>
  </items>
</field-set>
----

<1> Use the `items` element place other inputs inside the field set.

.A field set grouping
image::field-set.png["A field set containing TextLine and TextArea inputs. The field set groups them visually and adds a shared heading.", {image-s}, align=center]

== Item sets

Item sets also allow you to group input fields, but as opposed to field sets, item sets group values _both_ visually _and_ on a structural level. Item sets can be arbitrarily nested.

- The https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/cms/schemas/item-set[item set documentation^] does a standout job of explaining exactly how they work, so check that out for an overview.

.An item set containing contact info
image::item-set-sample.png["A pair of visually grouped inputs on a card element. The card has a header that says 'contact info'. There is also a button to add more contact info forms.", {image-s}, align=center]

== Option sets

Option sets enable editors (working in Content Studio) to choose from a set of predefined options. This is similar to the ComboBox element, but option sets also allow options to carry extra data.

Option sets where users can select only one of a number of options are known as _single-select_ option sets. You can also use a _multi-select_ option set if the user should be able to select multiple options simultaneously. We'll look at this too in a task.

- The https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/cms/schemas/option-set[option set reference documentation^] provides a good overview (with accompanying pictures) of how option sets work.

.A multi-select option set
image::option-set-sample.png["An input form labelled 'multi-selection'. The user has selected one out of four options. Some options contain extra data such as an image selector or other input fields.", {image-s}, align=center]

== Mixins

_Mixins_ facilitate a form of reuse in XP. They allow you to reuse fields across several content types. 

They won't look or behave any different from if you manually typed the same fields into multiple content types, but it lets you keep them in sync.  

Mixins go in the `/src/main/resources/site/mixins` directory, following the same naming pattern as the other schemas we've seen (`<mixin-name>/<mixin-name>.xml`).

We'll see them in the upcoming task, but if you want to learn more about them, consult https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/cms/schemas/mixins[the mixins reference documentation].

== Tasks

So far we've theoretically presented sets. For a proper understanding of those concepts, we'll introduce some tasks. Make sure to follow along in order to strengthen your knowledge on this subject.

=== Adding an item set to {content-type-1-capitalized}

Let's add an item set to the `{content-type-1-capitalized}`. The goal will be to add a Filmography item set, featuring where and when a specific artist was featured in a movie.

To add an item set, use it as you would any other input type: place it within the `form` element of a content type. 

If we add it to the `{content-type-1-capitalized}` content type, it'd look something like this:

.{content-type-1-capitalized} with an added Item Set
[source,xml,{subs}]
----
<content-type>
  <display-name>{content-type-1-capitalized}</display-name>
  <description>A description of an {content-type-1}</description>
  <super-type>base:structured</super-type>
  <form>

    <!-- Other fields elided for brevity -->

    <item-set name="filmography">
      <label>Filmography</label>
      <occurrences minimum="0" maximum="0" />
      <items> // <1>
        <input name="title" type="TextLine">
          <label>Title</label>
          <occurrences minimum="1" maximum="1" />
        </input>
        <input name="year" type="Double">
            <label>Year</label>
            <occurrences minimum="1" maximum="1" />
            <config>
              <min>0</min>
            </config>
        </input>
      </items>
    </item-set>

  </form>
</content-type>
----

<1> Much like with field sets, use the `items` element to nest inputs within the item set.

Note that the remaining fields of the form have been left out in the above example.

With this new item set added to the {content-type-1-capitalized} content type, make sure to add some data:

.Item set for filmography
image::artist-filmography-item-set.png["An example of using the Filmography item set.", {image-l}]

=== Adding an option set to {content-type-2-capitalized}

In this section, we'll use option sets to add some extra data to `{content-type-2-capitalized}` data type. The goal is:

- Add an option set for feeding behavior. Intentionally simplified, this option set should indicate whether the animal is an herbivore or a carnivore. If it is a carnivore, it should also let the user add a list of prey.
- Create a mixin for distribution options. Because each distribution option should have the same fields, create a _mixin_ to reuse it.
- Add an option for distribution across continents. The user should be able to select as many as they want from the 7 continents to indicate where the animal lives. Each option should have an associated `TextArea` called "notes", where the user can add more data for each option.

==== Single-select: dietary data

Open your {content-type-2} content type and add a single-select option set.  As before, we use option sets as we would any other input type.

.The `{content-type-2-capitalized}` content type with feeding behavior
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<content-type>
  <display-name>Animal</display-name>
  <description>An animal that lives on planet Earth</description>
  <super-type>base:structured</super-type>
  <form>

    <!-- other fields elided for brevity -->

    <option-set name="feedingBehavior">
      <label>Feeding behavior</label>
      <options minimum="1" maximum="1"> // <1>

        <option name="herbivore"> // <2>
          <help-text>Subsists primarily on plant material.</help-text>
          <label>Herbivore</label>
        </option>

        <option name="carnivore"> // <3>
          <label>Carnivore</label>
          <help-text>Subsists primarily on animal tissue and meat.</help-text>
          <items>
            <input name="prey" type="TextLine">
              <label>Prey</label>
              <occurrences minimum="0" maximum="0" />
            </input>
          </items>
        </option>

      </options>
    </option-set>

  </form>
</content-type>
----

<1> This specifies that if you add feeding behavior, you must select one of the options, and you can not select more than one.
<2> The herbivore option has no associated data, so it consists solely of a label.
<3> The carnivore option allows you to optionally specify prey for the animal.

==== Multi-select: distribution

. Start by creating the mixin. Call it `distributionData` and place it in `src/main/resources/site/mixins/distributionData/distributionData.xml`. It only contains a text area:
+
.The `distributionData` mixin
[source,xml,{subs}]
----
<mixin>
  <display-name>Distribution data</display-name>
  <form>

    <input type="TextArea" name="notes">
      <label>Notes</label>
    </input>

  </form>
</mixin>
----

. Moving onto {content-type-2}s, add the multi-select option set.
+
.The `{content-type-2-capitalized}` content type with distribution data
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<content-type>
  <display-name>Animal</display-name>
  <description>An animal that lives on planet Earth</description>
  <super-type>base:structured</super-type>
  <form>

    <!-- other fields elided for brevity -->

    <option-set name="distribution">
      <label>Distribution across continents</label>
      <help-text>Continents where the animal can be found in the wild</help-text>
      <options minimum="0" maximum="0"> // <1>

        <option name="africa">
          <label>Africa</label>
          <items>
            <mixin name="distributionData" />
          </items>
        </option>

        <option name="antarctica">
          <label>Antarctica</label>
          <items>
            <mixin name="distributionData" />
          </items>
        </option>

        <option name="asia">
          <label>Asia</label>
          <items>
            <mixin name="distributionData" />
          </items>
        </option>

        <option name="australia">
          <label>Australia</label>
          <items>
            <mixin name="distributionData" />
          </items>
        </option>

        <option name="europe">
          <label>Europe</label>
          <items>
            <mixin name="distributionData" />
          </items>
        </option>

        <option name="northAmerica">
          <label>North America</label>
          <items>
            <mixin name="distributionData" />
          </items>
        </option>

        <option name="southAmerica">
          <label>South America</label>
          <items>
            <mixin name="distributionData" />
          </items>
        </option>

      </options>
    </option-set>

  </form>
</content-type>
----

<1> This specifies that you can add as many distributions as you want.

NOTE: The use of the `mixin` helps us both reduce duplication and keep all options in sync. If we wanted to add more data, such as current population, we would only have to add it to the `mixin` to have it duplicate to all distributions.

=== Result

With the new option sets and added, the Lion entry could look something like this:

.Distribution and feeding behavior for Lion
image::option-sets.png["Diet and distribution data filled out for lion. The feeding behaviour selected is 'Carnivore' and the list of prey includes zebras and giraffes. For the distribution data, Africa and Asia is selected, with a short text about how Lions live in these areas today.", {image-xl}]

== Querying item sets and option sets

Let's look at how option and item sets work in headless contexts.

=== Item sets

Getting item sets via GraphQL is not much different than anything else we've seen:

.Fetching an {content-type-1-capitalized} filmography
[source,GraphQL,{subs}]
----
{
  guillotine {
    queryDsl(
      query: {
        boolean: {
          must: [
            {
              term: {
                field: "type",
                value: {
                  string: "{project-name-full}:{content-type-1}"
                }
              }
            },
            {
              term: {
                field: "displayName",
                value: {
                  string: "Cardi B"
                }
              }
            }
          ]
        }
        
      }
    ) {
      displayName
      ... on {project-name-query}_{content-type-1-capitalized} {
        data {
          filmography {
            title
            year
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----

With some data added for Cardi B, you'd get a result like this:

.Album data

{
  "data": {
    "guillotine": {
      "queryDsl": [

                "year": 2017
              },
              {
                "title": "Hip Hop Squares",
                "year": 2017
              },
              {
                "title": "Saturday Night Live",
                "year": 2018
              },
              {
                "title": "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon",
                "year": 2018
              },
              {
                "title": "Untold Stories of Hip Hop",
                "year": 2019
              },
              {
                "title": "Rhythm + Flow",
                "year": 2019
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
----

=== Option sets

When fetching option set data, you can get the list of currently selected items and each item separately.

.Querying for feeding behavior and distribution

                field: "type",
                value: {
                  string: "{project-name-full}:{content-type-2}"

          ]
        }
        
      }
    ) {
