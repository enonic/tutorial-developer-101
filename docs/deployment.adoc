Working on your local copy is great for development, but you can't expose what you build to someone else that way. For that, you need to deploy XP and your app to somewhere. In this {document}, we'll give a high-level overview of how you do just that.

== Deployment

You have two main choices for deploying XP, as described below:

=== Enonic Cloud

This is our fully managed and hassle free hosting option. Sit back, relax and let Enonic take care of your infrastructure, including monitoring, backups, automation, and more.

Enonic Cloud is the easiest way of getting Enonic up and running. To learn more about it and get a free trial, head over to https://enonic.com/platform/platform-as-a-service[the Platform as a Service page].

=== Self-hosted (Software)

If Enonic Cloud isn't for you, you can also run the Enonic platform yourself. There's a number of different deployment strategies and subscription options to choose from, based on what suits your particular situation best.

To learn more about our software offerings and deployment strategies, check out https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/deployment[the _deployment_ section of the XP reference docs].

== Uploading apps

Regardless of how you deploy your XP instance, installing your application can be done in the same way.

To upload an app:

. Log into your XP deployment
. Use the admin menu to navigate to the applications page
. Choose install from the toolbar and upload your application `.jar` file. You can drag and drop your application or navigate the file hierarchy via the upload button.
+
.Drag and drop applications to upload them

NOTE: Deployment can also be done directly from https://developer.enonic.com/docs/enonic-cli/master/xp#app[CLI], which is useful in a https://developer.enonic.com/guides/ci-cd-for-xp-apps[Continuous Integration] setup.


[#vhosts]
== Virtual hosts = pretty URLs

When accessing XP resources such as the GraphQL API explorer in this tutorial, the URLs have been long and unsightly. When working in production environment, this isn't something you want. Instead, you want short, pretty URLs that are easy to remember. Virtual hosts (_vhosts_) configuration lets you do just that.

Your vhosts file is a configuration file that sits in your XP sandbox's configuration directory. This file contains mappings from public-facing URLs to internal URLs. This lets the user access `{p1-site-slug}.com/api` and retrieve content from `/site/default/master/{p1-site-slug}/api`.

An example vhosts file that achieves the mapping mentioned could contain the following:

[src,properties,{subs}]
----
enabled = true <--.-->

mapping.example.host = {p1-site-slug}.com <--.-->
mapping.example.source = / <--.-->
mapping.example.target = /site/default/master/{p1-site-slug}/ <--.-->
----
<.> Enable vhosts configuration
<.> Intercept requests to `{p1-site-slug}.com`
<.> Map any request that starts with this path ...
<.> ... to this internal URL.

To read more about virtual hosts, head to the https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/deployment/vhosts[_Vhosts_ section of the deployment documentation].

=== Task: local vhosts config

To explore how vhosts mappings work, let's configure vhosts for our local XP instance. Then, to test it, we'll configure our local `hosts` file.

NOTE: Because we'll create a mapping to the published version of the site, you should make sure your site is published as described in <<content#publishing, the content chapter>>. Mapping to the draft version of your site would require changing the site's permissions, which isn't covered until the {next-chapter}.

. Find and open your sandbox's vhosts file. From your user's home directory, the path will be `.enonic/sandboxes/<sandbox-name>/home/config/com.enonic.xp.web.vhost.cfg`, where `<sandbox-name>` varies depending on which sandbox you want to configure. If it is your first one, it'll be `Sandbox1`.

. Update the vhosts file.
+
[source,config,{subs}]
----
enabled = true

mapping.site.host = {vhost-host} <--.-->
mapping.site.source = /
mapping.site.target = /site/default/master/{p1-site-slug}/api

mapping.localhost.host = localhost <--.-->
mapping.localhost.source = /
mapping.localhost.target = /
mapping.localhost.idProvider.system = default
----
+
<.> If requests go to `{vhost-host}`, send them to the target at `{p1-api-path}`. Note that this does not affect port mapping, so you'd still need to append the port (`:8080`) for your local setup.
<.> This block allows the localhost mappings to keep working. Without this, `localhost:8080` wouldn't work anymore. We'll talk more about the ID provider line in the {next-chapter}.
+
. If you're watching your XP process, you should see a message like this:

  2021-06-09 13:49:43,405 INFO  c.e.x.s.i.config.ConfigInstallerImpl - Loaded config for [com.enonic.xp.web.vhost]
  2021-06-09 13:49:43,411 INFO  c.e.x.w.v.i.c.VirtualHostServiceImpl - Virtual host is enabled and mappings updated.
+
This means that XP has updated the mappings and is ready to go.

. To test this out, update your local hosts file (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_%28file%29[_hosts file_ on Wikipedia]) to point `{vhost-host}` to `127.0.0.1` by adding the following line to the file:
+
[source,conf,{subs}]
----
127.0.0.1 {vhost-host}
----
+
TIP: On Linux and macOS you'll find the hosts file at `/etc/hosts`. On Windows, it's located at  `c:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts`

. Now access `http://{vhost-host}:8080/api` in your browser. If all has gone well, you should see the GraphQL API explorer.


==== Troubleshooting

If you're not seeing anything when you direct your browser to `http://{vhost-host}:8080/api` or aren't able to access the resources, that may be due to a browser setting. Try using a different browser and see if that makes a difference. Alternatively, you can try running

[source,bash,{subs}]
----
curl --head {vhost-host}:8080/api
----

If the connection is successful, your output should look something like this:

[{subs}]
----
HTTP/1.1 200 OK <--.-->
Date: Wed, 04 Aug 2021 09:32:22 GMT
Content-Type: text/html;charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 1657
----

<.> This indicates that the request was successful. This is the most important part. As long as it says `200 OK` you can ignore the rest of the message. You can https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes[read more about HTTP status codes on Wikipedia]

You might not be able to do much with that output, but it means the mapping has worked successfully, which is the important part for this task.

== Next steps

Nice work; you've exposed the site to the web and given everyone access to it! But you've also given _everyone_ access to it. Often, you'll want to restrict access to certain parts of your site and require users to log in. The {next-chapter} covers permissions and access control.
